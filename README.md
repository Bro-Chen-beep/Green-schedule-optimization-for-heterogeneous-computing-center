Each job should be allocated to only one machine
Each job has a processing time to complete in a machine
Each machine has a given power consumption according to speed of operation to process the job in the machine

Goal: Allocate all jobs in the machines, to define their sequences on machines and to find their processing speed, minimizing the makespan and the total consumption of electricity

## Objective

minimize energy:                                               𝑀𝑖𝑛:𝑐𝑚𝑎𝑥
 
minimize penalty:                                              𝑀𝑖𝑛:𝑇𝐸𝐶
